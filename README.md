# Greetings ! 👋
I'm Ambroise, I'm a french Web Developper and this is my GitHub :)

## 💻 Web Development
This is my first activity. I'm studying it since May 15th, 2023.
I have solid bases in the Front End part and now currently learning Back End.

## 😎 My Coding Passion
I love to create some little things like a discord bot, or modding my favourite games 👀.
I created a general bot in my private discord server (repo on github soon), and some
mods on various games like Curious Expedition, Civ 6 or Minecraft for fun.
